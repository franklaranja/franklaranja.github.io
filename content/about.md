I’m a Rust programmer and consultant dedicated to crafting high-quality code
that brings your projects to life. Since diving into Rust in 2018, I’ve been
captivated by its powerful tools, fast performance, and unique type system
that ensures reliability. My small Rust shop is built on a passion for
open-source, where I create [crates](/code) designed with precision and care.

With experience spanning web development, command-line tools, parsing, macros,
and databases, I tackle diverse challenges with ease. My Master’s degree
in biology gives me a unique perspective, allowing me to understand your
domain and deliver tailored solutions—whether for startups, charities, or
larger organizations. I value clear communication and personal collaboration,
ensuring every project feels handcrafted.
